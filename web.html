 <h1>Web</h1>
 The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where
 documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
 (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.

 English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote

 The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research
